Create an AngularX(2+) SPA(Single Page Application) that uses the following components from material.angular.io and primefaces.org/primeng/

I would recommend making at least a few pages for organizing the components. What pages you make are up to you. make sure everything is navigable.

Please make a node/express API with an abstracted data layer with a database of your choice to handle a functioning CRUD. We use rethink, so if you want to give that a go, by all means.
